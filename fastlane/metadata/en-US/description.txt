My beloved city
For those like me, born and rised on Lima - Per√∫ this is my 2 cents to share the beauty of modern Peruvian Capital. Is near to celebrate its 200 years of independence and is setting up each and every corner to receive tourists all around the world. I promess I'll add more pictures and more locations by request, so if you are interested in one specific place, do not hesitate and write me a line to joe@colldev.com and I'll be glad to make growth this collection.
